         <p><center>Novy Bor is a town in the Liberec Region of the Czech Republic. From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. It has about 12,000 inhabitants. There is developed production of glass artifacts, small precision motors and, increasingly, tourism. The town is placed between Lusatian Mountains and Central Bohemian Uplands. First written document mentions this place in 1471 as village Arnsdorff (Arnultovice). During 17th and 18th century this place slowly grew into small town. In 1757 it got elevated into status of city, which was called Haida. In 1783 engineer Emanuel Kleinwachter had created plan for the new city with lots of gardens and city green. Since end of 18th century Novy Bor became known for its high concentration of glass industry (as happened in the whole region).</center></p>
