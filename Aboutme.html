         <p><center>My name is Marijana Kaljevicova, but in closing credits of my videos I appear under the name Mia Kaljevic. I'm originaly from Czech republic, but for the last 3 years I've been living in New York City. I'm a student at the Borough of Manhattan Community College with a major in Video Arts and Technology. My goal is set on becoming a film director.</center></p>
         <p><center>"Art of Czech Glass Blowing" is one of my first project, which firstly was created as a school assigment, but actually it inspired me in many other ways. As I mentioned before, I'm originally from a small town Ceska Lipa in Czech Republic, which is about 15minutes from the town Novy Bor (the one which is mentioned in the documentary). Glass-blowing tradition has been passed on for many generations in this region, and it's something for which we are most famous for. So when I had to created a short documentary as a school assigment, Czech glass-making was my top choice.</center></p>
         <p><center>Recently, "Art of Czech Glass Blowing" was part of a BMCC Film Festival in documentary section. After seeing people's reaction and their opinion about this short documentary, I actually decided that I would like to turn this small project into something bigger. During this year I would like to create a series of short documentaries, which will show and describe to the audience other traditional handcrafted professions in Czech Republic. For example one of my next projects will be about Czech Glass Beads. </center></p>
         <p><center>This is one of my small projects from Fall Semester 2017. Our assigment was to create our own version of Kuleshov Experiment.</center></p>

         <p><center>During Fall 2016 I took a Directing Class at SVA (School of Visual Arts). This is my final project from this class, where our goal was to shoot a scene from our favorite film. In my case I chose "Murder on the Orient Express". In this project I took part as the Director and Editor.</center></p>
