         <p><center>During filming "Art of Czech Glass Blowing" I had a chance to see whole process of glass-blowing, as you could see in this short documentary. Michael Masek -- who is a subject in this documentary -- has been a glass-blower for over 20 years. He is from Czech Republic, where he and his team are based in town Novy Bor. They work under a company named VERREUM PRAGUE. Each day they spent about 8 hours by a glass-blowing furnace. Their work day usually starts between 5 and 6am.</center></p>
