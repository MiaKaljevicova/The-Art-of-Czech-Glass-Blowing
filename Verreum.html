     	 <p><center>Verreum PRAGUE is a Czech company, where the phenomenon of quality Czech hand-blown glass is wonderfully combined with contemporary creative design represented by both Czech and foreign personalities. The new brand which was established in 2009 and chose a name combining the French word "verre" (glass) and the Czech "um" (art) has succeeded in garnering reputation on the international scene. It also makes itself known as co-organizer of the appealing and beneficial project Glass is Tomorrow based on collaboration of the best glass-blowers and designers from all of Europe.</center></p>
     	 <p><center>The brand speciality is the traditional technique of silver plating which has all but disappeared in Europe today. In its glassworks in Novy Bor and in some cases in collaboration with other Czech factories it produces original designs of such creators as Arik Levy, Karim Rashid, Rony Plesl, Sebastian Bergne and Jiri Pelcl. We find among the designs vases, jars, and tableware.</center></p>
